# CatalanNumber
Counting problems are always intersting. Most of them exploit recursion with usually quadratic or even exponetial time complexity. However, a fantastic mathematic method, which were explored half of century ago is now helping us solved such kind of problems with constant time. It called "Catalan Number" !

I am big fan of football, so after I heard about the term "Catalan", I immediately thinking about my favourite team FC Barcelona :D. But that's not. In this we will present some issue which can be done effectively done by using Catalan Number

Here they are:

1. Balanced Parentheses
2. Mountain Ranges
3. Diagonal-Avoiding Paths
4. Polygon Triangulation
5. Hands Across a Table
6. Binary Trees
7. Plane Rooted Trees
8. Skew Polyominos
9. Multiplication Orderings

On each problem we will try to solve it with "Developer's Mind" first , then see how effective it is when solving it with "Mathematist's Mind".
